# Beyond Code

I‚Äôve always believed technology is more than circuits and code ‚Äî it‚Äôs a way to shape how people live, connect, and grow.  

What excites me isn‚Äôt just building systems that work, but creating ones that **matter**: tools that empower communities, make learning accessible, and move us toward a more sustainable future.  

Curiosity drives me ‚Äî the kind that asks not only *‚ÄúHow does this work?‚Äù* but *‚ÄúHow can this help?‚Äù*  
That mindset has guided me from classrooms to clubs, from leading peers to mentoring others, and it continues to shape the kind of engineer I want to become.  

I‚Äôm not just seeking to master intelligence in machines. I want to understand how the intelligence we build can reflect our values ‚Äî collaboration, creativity, and care for the world we share.
