## üåç Beyond Code

I‚Äôve always believed technology should **empower communities**.  
That‚Äôs why I founded **STEM for All**, a grassroots initiative bringing hands-on STEM education to underserved schools in Mumbai.  

When I‚Äôm not coding or soldering, you‚Äôll find me exploring sustainability, piloting FPV drones, or mentoring peers in building AI-powered systems.
